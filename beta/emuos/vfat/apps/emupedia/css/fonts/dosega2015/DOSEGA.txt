This is a TrueType font (TTF), that is an exact copy of the font used by DOS. I made it using the FontForge software, and the *.CPI fonts bundled with FreeDOS as a model.
DOS/EGA is a Unicode-BMP font, therefore it may be used without troubles on modern, multilingual systems. It supports english, french, polish, german, and probably several other languages. Beside its "retro" value, it's a great replacement to the oldish "fixedsys" font.
